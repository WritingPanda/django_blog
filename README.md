# Building a Blog with Django 1.9

I want to learn more about what is new with Django and get a deeper sense of the framework.

So naturally, I am building a blog with it! I am also following a tutorial using a different version of Python than I am.

Here's the link: [Try Django 1.9](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEsfXFp6DpzQFqfCur9CJ4QnKQTVXUsRy).

He also does other great tutorials, and he goes at a quick speed. There are moments where I have to skip over, but that's okay.

Anyway, here it is. It's nothing special. It is just meant to help me practice Django some more. Hooray!
